if we want to use many images in our project ...

then put them in a folder and put that folder in 

public Folder 


..........

to use them make a simple file in src file 
as

Menu.jsx 
---------

const Menu = [
	{
		id : 1,
		image : 'images/aloopakoda'

		or 

		image : './images/aloopakoda'

		or 

		image : '../images/aloopakoda'

		or 

		image : './../images/aloopakoda'

		
		we can use any path
	}
]
