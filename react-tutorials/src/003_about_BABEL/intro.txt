its a runtime compiler for the reactsjs 

it comes when we import React 

it simply do th task of convrting the code to react readable form 

if we want to test how it is working

go to google >>> 

		type "Babel"
		go inside the website and click "try it out"

		paste the line >>>
		ReactDOM.render( < h1 > hello world Prince.. < /h1>, document.getElementById('root'));

		at writing code we write that code in index.js file ....
		but it will convert it to

		ReactDOM.render(React.createElement("h1", null, "Hello World Prince"), document.getElementById("root"));

its the work of Babel
