>>>  component based approach   <<<

* a component is one of the core buiding block of react. in other words , we can say that every application you will develop in react will be made of pieces called components. components make the task of building UIs much easier.

declarative programming is a programming paradigm 
that expresses the logic of a computation without discribing its control flow.

declarative programming is like asking your friend to draw a landscape. ypu don't care how they draw it, that's up to them.
